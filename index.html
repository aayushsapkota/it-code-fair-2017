                          The development of new courses in Information Technology at Charles Darwin University has brought greater attention to the role of coding in the discipline.  With a Masters in IT (Software Engineering), a Bachelor of Software Engineering and the  Bachelor of Information Technology, students now have many more opportunities to build software products: applications, databases; mobile and responsive web sites and apps.</p><p>
                            To encourage and support students’ coding development a code fair was organized to enable students to showcase their work developed during the year more broadly within the  University and industry community while reaching out to the secondary school community.</p>
                            <p>
                              Code Fair Events</p>
                              <p>
                                The Code Fair included three major activities:</p>

                                  <ol>
                                  <li><h3>Coding competition</h3>
                                  <p> The competition was open to all 2014 IT students who had created apps; programs; mobile prototypes, websites, games that demonstrate their developing knowledge, skills in building elegant, maintainable code that works.
                                    18 students submitted 20 examples of their work. Students were judged by a panel of industry judges in categories associated with their level of study: Post graduate individual and group; Undergraduate individual and group. Prize winners are listed opposite.</p></li>

                                    <li><h3>Promoting code as the new literacy: workshops for school students</h3>

                                      <p>Supporting the global ‘Hour of Code’ initiative to develop coding literacies, three x one hour workshops were run for two local schools (Lutheran Christian College Year 9’s and Darwin High Year 10’s) and 15 university staff.  Feedback from students and staff was very positive and supportive. </p></li>
                                       <li><h3>Industry Employer Speed Dating </h3>
                                         <p> Graduating Masters and Undergraduate students and students needing work placements were given an opportunity to meet 11 local employers in the Speed Dating event.

                        <p>Introduction
                          The third Business and IT Code Fair was held at Charles Darwin University’s North Australian Centre for Oil and Gas, November 11 from 9am – 3pm and was attended by a record number of students, industry partners and members of the IT and University communities.</p>
                          <p>
                            NT Minister Lauren Moss (Minister for Corporate Information Services) opened the event and presented Academic Excellence awards to 12 students who had achieved the highest grades in individual IT units from first semester 2016. This included local and off campus students who were flown to Darwin to receive their awards and participate in the Code Fair. The sponsorship to make this new initiative possible, was provided by the NT Department of Corporate Information Services.  </p>
                            <p>
                              <p>A second exciting addition to the Code Fair was a keynote presentation from Glenn Irvine (National Practice Manager Google Solutions for Dialog Information Technology) on Google’s Emerging Technologies where Glenn outlined some of the latest ongoing developments within Google regarding Google Cloud; Google Home, self-driving cars, robots and virtual reality. A Google Home device (a small speaker smart home system) was donated to the Code Fair as a prize for the People’s Choice awards voted by visitors to the Code Fair and presented by Minister Moss at the end of the day.  The sponsorship from Dialog Information Technology to organize Glenn to present at the Code Fair and provide the Google Home was terrific.</p>

                             <p> Code Fair Events</p>
                              <p>
                                The Code Fair included six major activities:</p>

                                  <ol>
                                  <li><h3>Business Innovation Challenge</h3>
                                  <p> A new initiative, a Business Innovation Challenge, was introduced as a lead up event to 2016 Code Fair. Launched 6 weeks out from the Code Fair (just before end of semester assessment period!) this challenge, provided by the NT government, presented a real-life problem to students regarding how to communicate NT Road conditions using 21st century technologies. 7 students (1 team and 3 individuals) participated in the competition and the industry judges and academic staffs were highly impressed with the level of innovation all students displayed.  Students had to create a prototype and or concept for solving the problem and then communicate this through a 5 minute presentation.  Beside a monetary prize, the NT government have employed 5 students during summer as part of a development think tank so that their ideas can be turned into reality.</p></li>

                                    <li><h3>Coding competitions</h3>

                                      <p>The competition was open to all IT students (VET, and Higher Education) who had created apps; programs; mobile prototypes, websites, games that demonstrate their developing knowledge, skills in building elegant, maintainable code that works.   9 students submitted 9 examples of their works as individuals and 18 students submitted 7 examples of their works as 7 groups. Students were judged by a panel of industry judges in various categories associated with their level of study: novice, intermediate and advanced as individuals or groups. There was also an overall innovation prize awarded. One judge who has been part of the Code Fair since its inception noted that there was a much higher standard than last year. I think the projects were well presented and there was some very clever work in there. </p></li>
                                       <li><h3>Poster competition</h3>
                                         <p> he poster competition was introduced in 2015 to encourage students whose IT pathways to a future career was in the more analytical aspects of the profession. The poster competition aims to encourage students to communicate their IT work and develop and expand their visual communication skills. In 2016, 12 students submitted 14 examples of their work.  </p></li>
                                      
                                         <li><h3>Code Hour Workshops</h3> 
                                         <p>Supporting the global ‘Hour of Code’ initiative to develop coding literacies, four x one hour (4 x 1 hour) workshops were run for 45 students from 3 local high schools (Casuarina Senior College, Darwin High School and Essington) and university staff.  Students from Casuarina Secondary School spent the day at the code fair participating in many of the events on the day while 20 university staff attended the Coding workshop which was very popular.</p></li>
                                      
                                         <li><h3>Industry Employer Speed Dating</h3>
                                         <p>Employer Speed provides graduating students an opportunity to meet local employers. This year there were two speed dating categories for students to enter: developer;  and IT support and networking. 18 students took up the opportunity (13 Masters students &amp; 5 UG students).  Four new employers joined the 2016 Speed Dating  and the timing for the ‘speed dating’ includes 1 minute for the student to make a pitch to a prospective employer and 2 minutes for the employer to ‘interview’ the students. Students are only allowed to participate in the speed dating if they have attended a preparation session which looks at aspects of: appropriate dress; body language; oral presentation skills and CV preparations.  Students are giving an opportunity to trial their 1 minute pitch with all students asked to give feedback on how to make it better.</p></li>
                                          <li><h3>Academic Excellence awards</h3>
                                          <p>To encourage a greater emphasis on academic endeavours, this year a new category was introduced to recognise students who achieve highly in each subject taught in IT. Students who receive this award earn the highest scores in each unit.  This initiative enabled the university to also reach out to our off campus students and two students were flown to Darwin courtesy of sponsorship from DCIS.  9 students were recognise for their academic endeavours and they are listed above. </p></li>
